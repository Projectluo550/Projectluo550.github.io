Note for Italian users: If the above links give you a notice that the site is blocked, then either change your DNS server settings or use a VPN or try the onion site with the Tor browser. The Italian government is blocking Zlibrary URLs

If you'd want to go directly to the Artiles Search, then you can use articles.sk

'I Am Human' loop
Sometimes, while using the Zlibrary site, you can experience the 'I Am Human' loop or 'CloudFlare loop'. When this happens it's quite a nuisance to get rid of, if ever. It happens quite often on many websites, with all browsers. It has nothing to do with a problem at the Zlibrary site, but is a 'cloudflare' problem.

OVER.
